This is the Astroweight Calculator, the first project for the Web102 course.

After choosing whether or not pluto should be considered a planet in the list, writing in a weight and selecting a planet will display the relative weight if it were located at the selected location. If the user needs to measure based on a planet not in the initial list, they can type in a new planet with it's associated weight, and press the affiliated button to add it to the planet selection for measuring.
